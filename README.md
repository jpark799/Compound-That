# Compound That!
---
A compounding interest calculator I created for my mom because she recently downloaded Robinhood. 
Live version of project can be found [here](https://compoundthat.herokuapp.com/).

## Background
My mother recently became very interested in financial markets and we’ve had some very passionate discussions regarding trade wars, undervalued industries, and the health of the financial market as a whole. She’s constantly looking up historical rates of return for different financial assets so I thought it would be a fun project to build out a compounding interest calculator. I had a good idea of what I wanted the project to look like so I was able to present the basic wireframe to my mother, take in feedback, and execute the project.

## Wireframe
This was the initial wireframe that I drew up. I decided to add a daily option for contribution and compound frequency to the final version as well as consolidating the options into 2 columns.
